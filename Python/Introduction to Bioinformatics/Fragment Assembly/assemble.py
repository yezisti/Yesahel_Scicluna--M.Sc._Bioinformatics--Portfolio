# locates text file containing the overlapping fragments
text = open('C:\\Users\\yesah\\Documents\\fragments.txt')    # amend filepath as necessary

# reads and stores fragments line by line
fragments = [line.strip() for line in text]

'''
This program exploits two fragment relationships in performing fragment reassembly. It detects:

(1) Which fragment shares the longest suffix with the prefix of another fragment
    - Reveals which fragment should follow the other

(2) Which fragment shares no prefix with the suffix of any another fragment
    - Reveals which fragment is the first in sequence
