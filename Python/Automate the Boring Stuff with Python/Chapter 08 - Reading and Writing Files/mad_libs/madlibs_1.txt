*A Day at the Zoo*

Today, my friends and I went to the zoo. We saw a(n) [adjective] [animal name] jumping up and down in its tree. It [verb, pt] through the large tunnel that led to its [adjective] [place name]. I got some peanuts and passed them through the cage to a gigantic gray [animal name] towering above my head. Feeding that animal made me hungry. I went to get a(n) [adjective] scoop of ice cream. It filled my stomach. Afterwards, we had to hurry home, but I had fun watching the [adjective] [animal name] at the zoo.
