def close_gaps(folder, prefix, file_ext, places):
    '''
    Args:
    - folder(str.): the path of the folder containing the files to process
    - prefix(str.): the name of the files (excluding numbering) to process
    - file_ext(str.): the extension of the files to process (e.g. '.pdf', '.txt', '.csv', etc.)
    - places(int.): the number of places in the files' numbering (e.g. 1 if 0-9, 2 if 00-99, 3 if 000-999, etc.)

    Output:
    - searches the specified folder for the files with the specified prefix and file extension and
      locates any gaps in their numbering (such as if there is a spam001.txt and spam003.txt but no spam002.txt); 
      renames the files as necessary in order to close said gaps
