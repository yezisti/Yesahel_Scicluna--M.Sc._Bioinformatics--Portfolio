# chess_board_validator.py - Task Description

_From Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. Chapter 5. Practice Project - Chess Dictionary Validator:_

In this chapter, we used the dictionary value `{'1h': 'bking', '6c': 'wqueen', '2g': 'bbishop', '5h': 'bqueen', '3e': 'wking'}` to represent a chess board. Write a function named `isValidChessBoard()` that takes a dictionary argument and returns `True` or `False` depending on if the board is valid.

A valid board will have exactly one black king and exactly one white king. Each player can only have at most 16 pieces, at most 8 pawns, and all pieces must be on a valid space from `'1a'` to `'8h'`; that is, a piece canâ€™t be on space `'9z'`. The piece names begin with either a `'w'` or `'b'` to represent white or black, followed by `'pawn'`, `'knight'`, `'bishop'`, `'rook'`, `'queen'`, or `'king'`. This function should detect when a bug has resulted in an improper chess board.
