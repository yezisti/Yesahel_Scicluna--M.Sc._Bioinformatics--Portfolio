## 2. _BIO3110-Dissertation-Yesahel Scicluna_ (PDF):
- The original report I submitted in completion of my undergrad dissertation (study-unit [BIO3110](https://www.um.edu.mt/courses/studyunit/BIO3110)). 

	- Throughout the course of this project, I:
    	- extracted DNA using proteinase K
    	- amplified a mitochondrial marker (the COI gene) using PCR
    	- confirmed amplification using gel electrophoresis
    	- processed (trimmed, edited, aligned) sequence data using [Geneious](https://www.geneious.com/)
    	- constructed phylogenetic trees using [MEGA](https://www.megasoftware.net/)
    	- derived species identfications by consulting the databases of [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and [BOLD](https://boldsystems.org/)
		
	- This dissertation was worth a total of 18 ECTS credits, and the final mark I obtained was 89.
